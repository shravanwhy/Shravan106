    <h2>Career Highlights</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Virat Kohli's career has been nothing short of extraordinary, marked by numerous records and accolades that have cemented his legacy as one of the greatest cricketers in the world. He first burst onto the international scene in 2008 after leading India to victory in the ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup. Kohli made his senior debut for the Indian cricket team later that year in an ODI against Sri Lanka, and from there, his rise was meteoric. Known for his aggressive yet calculated batting style, Kohli quickly became an integral part of the Indian middle order. His ability to anchor the innings while chasing daunting targets earned him the title of the "Chase Master." One of his most iconic performances came during the 2012 Asia Cup, where he scored a magnificent 183 against Pakistan, the highest score of his ODI career, leading India to a famous victory. Kohli's consistency in ODIs was further demonstrated when he became the fastest player to score 8,000, 9,000, and 10,000 runs in the format, surpassing legends like Sachin Tendulkar. His ability to dominate in all three formats of the game is unparalleled; he has amassed over 70 international centuries across Tests and ODIs, placing him among the highest run-scorers in cricket history. In Test cricket, Kohli's leadership skills shone through when he took over the captaincy from MS Dhoni in 2014, leading India to several memorable series victories, including an unprecedented series win in Australia in 2018-19. Under his captaincy, India became the number one Test team in the world, a position they held for several years. His aggressive leadership style and commitment to fitness raised the bar for Indian cricket, inspiring a new generation of players to prioritize athleticism and discipline. Kohli also played a pivotal role in the Indian Premier League (IPL), captaining the Royal Challengers Bangalore and setting numerous records, including being the highest run-scorer in a single IPL season, with 973 runs in 2016. His versatility as a player is evident in his ability to adapt to various formats and conditions, making him one of the most formidable batsmen of his era. Though Kohli stepped down from his role as India's captain in 2021, his impact on the game remains profound. His numerous awards, including the ICC Cricketer of the Year on multiple occasions and his place in the ICC ODI and Test Teams of the Decade, further underline his dominance in world cricket. Kohli’s hunger for runs, unwavering determination, and the sheer volume of his achievements make his career one of the most illustrious in cricket history.

        Virat Kohli's personal life has garnered as much attention as his cricketing career, with the cricketer becoming a global icon both on and off the field.

In January 2021, they welcomed their first child, a daughter named Vamika, and have since been protective about her privacy, urging the media and fans to respect their decision not to reveal her to the public eye. Kohli's family life is one of balance; despite his hectic cricketing schedule, he has often spoken about the grounding influence of Anushka and how she has played a pivotal role in shaping his perspective on life beyond cricket.

In addition to his family commitments, Kohli has been involved in several philanthropic activities. He founded the Virat Kohli Foundation, which focuses on supporting underprivileged children and promoting sports at the grassroots level. His charitable efforts also extend to wildlife conservation and environmental causes, reflecting his growing interest in making a positive impact beyond cricket.
